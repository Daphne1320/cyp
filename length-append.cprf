Lemma: length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys

Proof by induction on List xs

Case []
    length ([] ++ ys)
    .=. length ys

    length [] + length ys
    .=. 0 + length ys
    .=. length ys

Case :
    length ((x:xs) ++ ys)
    .=. length (x : (xs ++ ys))
    .=. 1 + length (xs ++ ys)
    .=. 1 + (length xs + length ys)

    length (x:xs) + length ys
    .=. (1 + length xs) + length ys
    .=. 1 + (length xs + length ys)
