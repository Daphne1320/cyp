Lemma: length (xs ++ zs) .=. length xs + length zs

Proof by induction on List xs

Case []

    To show: length ([] ++ zs) .=. length [] + length zs

    Proof
                                 length ([] ++ zs)
        (by def ++)          .=. length zs

                                 length [] + length zs
        (by def length)      .=. 0 + length zs
        (by arith)           .=. length zs

Case x:xs

    To show: length ((x : xs) ++ zs) .=. length (x : xs) + length zs
    IH: length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys

    Proof
                                 length ((x:xs) ++ zs)
        (by def ++)          .=. length (x : (xs ++ zs))
        (by def length)      .=. 1 + length (xs ++ zs)
        (by IH)              .=. 1 + (length xs + length zs)

                             length (x:xs) + length zs
        (by def length)      .=. (1 + length xs) + length zs
        (by arith)           .=. 1 + (length xs + length zs)
