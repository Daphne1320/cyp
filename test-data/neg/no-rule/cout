Lemma : length (xs ++ ys) .=. length xs + length ys
    Induction over variable 'xs' of type 'List'
        Case 'x : xs'
            Equational proof
                Invalid proof step in line 31 (no rules with name "cheating")
                    1 + length xs~1 + length ys~0
                    (by cheating) .=. 1 + (length xs~1 + length ys~0)
